# AI Career Navigator

**SDG 4 – Quality Education | SDG 8 – Decent Work & Economic Growth**

Intentional career development rarely happens by accident. We designed the AI Career Navigator as an **orchestrated workflow** that takes someone from uncertainty to clarity via measurable checkpoints and human-friendly outputs.

## Local Setup (Verified Steps)

1. **Clone & install**
```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd Career-Navigator
   npm install
```

2. **Environment variables**
```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
```
   Fill in `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` from your Supabase
   project's **Settings → API** page. See `.env.example` for details.

3. **Run the app**
```bash
   npm run dev
```
   App runs on `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **Run tests / lint / typecheck**
```bash
   npm run test        # Vitest + React Testing Library
   npm run lint         # ESLint
   npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
```

## Workflow at a Glance

1. **Capture & Analyze** – intake a resume or raw profile, parse every section with AI, and compute an ATS readiness score.
2. **Generate & Optimize** – author a resume from scratch or polish the existing one with targeted phrasing, impact bullets, and formatting.
3. **Discover Skill Gaps** – compare strengths to target roles, flag missing capabilities, and prioritize learning.
4. **Learn & Practice** – translate gaps into curated, actionable learning pathways with checkpoints for mastery.
5. **Match & Apply** – surface role-specific openings, generate cover letters, and track application outcomes.
6. **Simulate Growth** – visualize salary trajectories, job stability, and career progression to inform decisions.
7. **Measure & Iterate** – monitor progress via skill acquisition, readiness scores, and behavioral insights for continuous personalization.

Each phase feeds data to the next, turning the user’s journey into a closed-loop system that adapts to changing aspirations.

## Detailed Workflow Phases

### 1. Capture & Analyze
- Upload an existing resume or import profile details.
- AI parses sections using NLP, extracts entities via NER, and evaluates the document against ATS heuristics.
- Outputs: ATS scorecard, formatting diagnostics, keyword alignment report.

### 2. Generate & Optimize
- For blank slates, the AI proposes section outlines, highlights relevant keywords, and suggests company-style language.
- For drafts, it reorders sections, expands impact-driven bullets, and normalizes formatting for compatibility.
- Outputs: downloadable resume draft, actionable revision checklist.

### 3. Discover Skill Gaps
- Semantic similarity compares the curated profile against live job descriptions.
- The system ranks missing or weak skill areas and translates them into prioritized learning needs.
- Outputs: skill gap matrix, role-targeted focus areas.

### 4. Learn & Practice
- Fetches resources from verified platforms (MOOCs, labs, documentation) or generates explanations via LLMs.
- Structures learning into micro-quests with completion checks and optional hands-on projects.
- Outputs: personalized learning roadmap, mastery tracker, encouragement nudges.

### 5. Match & Apply
- Tags the user’s expertise and searches aggregated job data (APIs, crawled datasets, partner feeds).
- Recommends opportunities based on salary, location, remote preference, and growth potential.
- Generates bespoke cover letters aligned to tone and role requirements.
- Outputs: filtered job list, application templates, next-step reminders.

### 6. Simulate Growth
- Uses industry datasets and historical trends to project salary growth, job stability, and progression likelihood.
- Visualizes alternate "what-if" pathways so users can weigh trade-offs before committing.
- Outputs: growth dashboard, confidence score, narrative summaries for mentors/advisors.

### 7. Measure & Iterate
- Tracks learning progress, resume revisions, job engagement, and confidence metrics.
- Recalibrates recommendations via feedback loops (learning completed, jobs applied to, responses received).
- Outputs: growth diary, readiness pulse, AI mentor reflections.

## AI-First Architecture

| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Interface** | Conversational onboarding, resume uploader, and dashboard that surfaces insights at every click. |
| **AI Orchestration** | NLP (parsing, ATS), semantic similarity models, recommendation agents, generative builders, and predictive analytics pipelines. |
| **Data Layer** | Profiles, job descriptions, learning content, salary datasets, user behavior signals stored securely for rapid retrieval. |
| **Feedback Loop** | Progress signals feed retraining and personalization to keep suggestions aligned with evolving goals. |

The platform is intentionally AI-first; no phase functions without the underlying intelligence stack.

## Impact

### SDG 4 – Quality Education
- Democratizes access to career capital regardless of background.
- Makes learning relevant through role-aligned personalization.
- Provides data-backed guidance for every step in the upskilling journey.

### SDG 8 – Decent Work
- Speeds up job readiness with ATS-vetted resumes and personalized applications.
- Connects talent to meaningful job opportunities instead of noise.
- Visualizes economic mobility via predictive growth modeling.

Success is measured in resume quality lifts, skill mastery completion, application rates, and employment outcomes.
